# REST-API-DB-Gig-Buddy-BE

People going to gigs, but don’t have friends with similar music taste and therefore have to go alone, or people who were planning on going with someone else to a gig, but dropped out at the last minute. In order to solve this problem, our team will create a social site on which users can find their own ‘gig buddy’.
